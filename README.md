## Part 1
### Imaging Technique Inspiration

In digital art, if some imaging technology that is different from other styles suddenly appears in the imaging, there will be a kind of visual collision.
I got some interesting inspiration from the movie *Pixels*. In the film, some pixel-style items become physical and appear in the real world. It brings a visual experience that combines games with reality.

I want to change the image style of some of the patterns in my project to pixel style, so that they contrast with other styles. I wanted to provide some sense of the clash of visual styles. If possible, these pixel style elements will be changing, not static.

## Part 2
### Coding Technique Exploration
To achieve this pixel-style graphics transformation effect, Youtuber __The Coding Train__ mentioned in an episode how to write cellular automata simulation code that can generate similar effects. It can change patterns automatically without clicking or selecting them, just like a cell automatically evolves. 

According to the provided code, the small pattern will automatically generate changes, and the interaction between the pattern and the pattern will generate a randomness. I can refer to this coding technique to dynamically change some of the visual elements of the background in real time, achieving a random aesthetic of visual style collisions.
